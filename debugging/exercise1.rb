# Will throw an error for incorrect number of arguments since the method is
# expecting one array argument, not 6 individual arguments.  This can be fixed
# by putting the arguments in an array.

# The 2nd line will work as is, but without the array it'll end up throwing an
# undefined method error since there's no integer class method each.
